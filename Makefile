# 2. What to build and how to build them
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The build rules are defined as follows:
# target : prerequisite files
#	How to build the target
# 1. Make program will first check whether the target exists in the folder.
# 2. If not it will check for prerequisite files.
# 3. If the prerequisite files all exist in the folder the program will execute
#    the next line to build the target.
# 4. If any of the prerequisite file does not exist, the program will look for 
#    rules to create the prerequisite file: it will look for rules where the
#    prerequisite file is the target.


# "all:" is the starting point of the build process unless specified otherwise.
# 1. The make program will look for targets (i.e., server and client) to build
# 2. If the target is not found in the folder it will look for
#    rules to build the target (it will look for "server: xxx" and "client: xxx"
#    which should define the rules to build the server and the client)

all: $(TARGET)

debug: DFLAGS := -ggdb -DDEBUG
debug: $(TARGET)
# "server:" defines rules to build the server.
# 1. To build the server binary we need compiled object files for the server.
#    We defined them above and the necessary object files are:
#    - $(SVR_OBJS) that includes all server specific object files and
#    - $(CMN_OBJS) that include all common object files that are used for both
#      server and client programs.
# 2. The next line $(CXX) $(LFALGS) -o $@ $^ defines how to create server
#    binary. This line translates to 
#
#      g++ -pthread -o server ServerXXX1.o ServerXXX2.o ... Common1.o ...
#
#    $@ is a macro for the string behind the colon (i.e., server).
#    $^ is a macro for all the string after the colon (i.e., $(SVR_OBJS) $(CMN_OBJS))
#
# 3. When you start compiling, however, you will only have .cpp and .h files
#    in the folder the make program won't be able to execute the g++ command and
#    it will look for another rules to create the object (.o) files

server: $(SVR_OBJS) $(CMN_OBJS)
	$(CXX) $(LFLAGS) -o $@ $^ 

# This rule defines how to build the server specific object files.
# To build object files, corresponding source code files (i.e., cpp and h files) are
# necessary. 
# Since we will have all the files the build command will be executed
#   g++ -Wall -std=c++0x -c ServerXXX1.cpp ServerXXX2.cpp ...

$(SVR_OBJS): $(SVR_SRCS) $(SVR_HDRS)

# Same applies to the client program.

	$(CXX) $(LFLAGS) -o $@ $^ 

$(CLNT_OBJS): $(CLNT_SRCS) $(CLNT_HDRS)
	$(CXX) $(CFLAGS) $(DFLAGS) -c $(CLNT_SRCS)
	

# This rule compiles the common source code into object files.

# This defines how you will clean up the compiled files.
# You can type "make clean" in the command line to delete all compiled files
# which include .o files and the compiled binary.

clean:
	rm -rf *.o $(TARGET)

# This indicates "clean" is not a target file to build but rather a
# special command.
